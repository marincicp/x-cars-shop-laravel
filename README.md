## X-Cars

Laravel - JS

This web application allows users (potential buyers) to search for and filter cars based on various criteria, view car details including the seller's contact number, and add cars to their watchlist. However, users must create an account before they can add cars to their watchlist.

For sellers, the application enables them to add cars to the platform, but only after their account has been verified. There is also an option for logging in via Google for easier access.

If a user forgets their password, a password reset functionality is available. Users can also update their personal information within the app, except for the email address if they registered via Google.

One useful feature is the ability to schedule a carâ€™s visibility. When adding or editing a car, sellers can choose a "publish date" in the future, meaning the car will not be visible until that date.

When a buyer adds a car to their watchlist, the seller will receive an email notification, which is implemented using Queue jobs and Mailtrap.
